                    Every child is like a seed that has the potential to grow if it is nourished with
                    love
                    and care under the right guidance. In the current challenging times, it is essential
                    that children should not only excel in academics but should also develop courtesy,
                    discipline, smart personality, social sensitivity, and be imbibed with the
                    traditional
                    values of the culture of our country. Childhood is the best time to lay the
                    foundation
                    of the core values essential for the overall development of the future citizen of
                    tomorrow. MKK School is a friendly school where each and every student
